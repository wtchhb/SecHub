A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Live Helper Chat
version â‰¤ 4.61 allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript by
injecting a crafted payload into the Personal Canned Messages. When an
admin or operator user views the message, and tries to send canned messages
the stored javascript executes in their browser context.

## Reproduction Steps:

1. Log in as an operator.
2. Navigate to your Personal Canned Messages.
3. Create new personal canned message, enter the following payload:
   ```
  "><img src="x" onerror="prompt(1);">
   ```
4. Save the changes.
5. Try to use the personal canned message, the cross site scripting (xss)
will execute.
