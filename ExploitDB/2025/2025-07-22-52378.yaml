A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Live Helper Chat
version â‰¤ 4.61 allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript by
injecting a crafted payload into the Facebook page integration Name Field.
The payload is stored and executed when higher-privileged users (e.g.,
administrators) access or edit the integration settings, resulting in
stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS).

## Reproduction Steps:

1. Log in as an operator.
2. Navigate to your Facebook page integration.
3. Create new Facebook page integration, enter the following payload in the
Facebook page integration Name Field:
   ```
  "><img src="x" onerror="prompt(1);">
   ```
4. Save the changes.
5. The payload is stored and executed when higher-privileged users (e.g.,
operator or administrators) access or edit the Facebook page integration,
resulting in stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS).
