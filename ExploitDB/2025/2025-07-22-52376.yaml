A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Live Helper Chat
version ≤ 4.61 allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript by
injecting a crafted payload into the Telegram Bot Username parameter. This
payload is stored and later executed when an admin or higher-privileged
user views or edits the Telegram Bot Username.


## Reproduction Steps:

1. Log in as an operator user in Live Helper Chat.
2. Navigate to `Settings > Live Help Configuration > Telegram Bot`.
3. In the **Bot Username** field, enter the following payload:
```
   "><img src="x" onerror="prompt(1);">
```
4. Save the settings.
5. Revisit the Telegram configuration panel and — the payload will execute.
