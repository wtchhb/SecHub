A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Live Helper Chat
version â‰¤ 4.61 allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript by
injecting a crafted payload into the Operator Surname field. This payload
is stored and later executed when an admin or higher-privileged user views
the Recipients List where the attacker is listed as the Owner.

## Reproduction Steps:

1. Log in as an operator.
2. Navigate to your Operator Surname field.
3. Create new Operator Surname or Modify the Operator Surname, enter the
following payload:
   ```
  "><img src="x" onerror="prompt(1);">
   ```
4. Save the changes.
5. This payload is stored and later executed when an admin or
higher-privileged user views the Recipients List where the attacker is
listed as the Owner.
