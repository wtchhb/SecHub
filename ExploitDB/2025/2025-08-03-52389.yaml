## Description

# CVE-2025-49741 Exploit Server
**Author:** nu11secur1ty (2025)

## Overview
This Python script simulates an exploit targeting a Microsoft Edge
(Chromium-based) information disclosure vulnerability identified as
**CVE-2025-49741**.

It runs two HTTP servers concurrently:

- **Malicious Server (port 8080):** Serves a crafted page that collects
victim headers and simulates an internal request to the exfiltration
endpoint.
- **Exfiltration Endpoint (port 1337):** Receives simulated internal
requests and logs headers for demonstration purposes.

## Components

### MaliciousRequestHandler
- Handles HTTP GET requests on port 8080.
- Logs the victim's IP address, User-Agent, and all request headers.
- Sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the exfiltration server on port 1337
with spoofed headers to simulate internal communication.
- Responds with an HTML page indicating that the victim's information is
being sent.

### ExfilEndpoint
- Handles HTTP GET requests on port 1337.
- Logs all headers received, simulating data exfiltration.
- Responds with a success message.

## Features
- Automatically detects the local IP address to bind the servers.
- Graceful shutdown on Ctrl+C (SIGINT), ensuring both servers close cleanly.
- Uses `ThreadingTCPServer` for responsive handling of multiple connections.
- Clear console logging for monitoring victim connections and exfiltration
simulation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- `requests` library (`pip install requests`)

## Usage
1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python CVE-2025-49741.py
   ```
2. The script will print the URLs where both servers are running (e.g.,
`http://192.168.x.x:8080` and `http://192.168.x.x:1337`).
3. Press Ctrl+C to stop both servers gracefully.

## Notes
- This tool is for educational and research purposes only.
- Do NOT use against systems you do not own or have explicit permission to
test.
- The exploit logic is simulated and does NOT perform real exploitation but
mimics the vulnerability for demonstration.
