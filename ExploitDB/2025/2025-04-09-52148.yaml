# Version: ADManager Plus Build < 7210
# Tested against: Build 7203
# CVE: CVE-2024-24409


# Description
The Modify Computers is a predefined role in ADManager for managing
computers. If a technician user has the Modify Computers privilege
over a computer can change the userAccountControl and
msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo attributes of the computer object. In this
way, the technician user can set Constrained Kerberos Delegation over
any computer within the Organizational Unit that the user was
delegated.

Contrary to what ADManager claims the user who has the Modify
Computers role can change the privilege of computer objects in the
Active Directory. The Constrained Kerberos Delegation can be set for
any service such as CIFS, LDAP, HOST services. Then the user can
access these services by abusing the Constrained Kerberos Delegation.
In addition, the Unconstrained Kerberos Delegation can be set over the
computer objects by changing the userAccountControl attribute.
Normally, only users that have SeEnableDelegationPrivilege privilege
can set constrained kerberos delegation. Only members of the
BUILTIN\Administrators group have this privilege by default. The
delegated user for an Organizational Unit can not set constrained
kerberos delegation even if a user has the GenericAll right over a
computer account, so the delegation process in Active Directory does
not grant this privilege. However, the technician user can use the
SeEnableDelegationPrivilege right via the Modify Computers role.

# Vulnerability reasons
1. ADMP Web App Authorization issue: Assigning a predefined Modify
Computers role delegates the technician user to modify custom
attributes of computers unexpectedly. Even though it appears that this
privilege is not granted in the UI, the Additional Custom Attribute
property is assigned and this leads to broken access control
vulnerability.

2. There is no restriction for editing the userAccountControl and
msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo attributes of the computer objects. The ADMP
application performs changes with domain admin privileges as designed
so that if we can bypass some restrictions (e.g. format of attribute
value), our requests are applied with domain admin privileges. This
way we can edit the attributes userAccountControl and
msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo.

# Impact
A technician user elevates privileges from Domain User to Domain
Admin. For example, the user can set Constrained Kerberos Delegation
over CLIENT1$ for the CIFS service of the domain controller and access
the CIFS service. As a result, the user is delegated to manage
CLIENT1$ but he can access the CIFS service of the domain controller
impersonating a user unexpectedly.
