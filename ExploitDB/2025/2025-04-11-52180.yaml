connectivity and open integration for your building automation systems. It's scalable,
and modular, allowing you to control a diverse range of HVAC functions.

Desc: A CSRF vulnerability has been identified in the ABB Cylon FLXeon series. However,
exploitation is limited to specific conditions due to the server's CORS configuration
(Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * without Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true). The
vulnerability can only be exploited under the following scenarios:
       Same Domain: The attacker must host the malicious page on the same domain as the
       target server.
       Man-in-the-Middle (MitM): The attacker can intercept and modify traffic between
       the user and the server (e.g., on an unsecured network).
       Local Area Network (LAN) Access: The attacker must have access to the same network
       as the target server.
       Subdomains: The attacker can host the malicious page on a subdomain if the server
       allows it.
       Misconfigured CORS: The server’s CORS policy is misconfigured to allow certain
       origins or headers.
       Reflected XSS: The attacker can exploit a reflected XSS vulnerability to execute
       JavaScript in the context of the target origin.
