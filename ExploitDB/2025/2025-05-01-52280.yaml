# Exploit title: Microsoft - NTLM Hash Disclosure Spoofing (library-ms)

Back in 2018, I reported a ".library-ms" File NTLM information disclosure vulnerability to MSRC and was told "it was not severe enough", that being said I post it anyways.
Seven years passed, until other researchers re-reported it.

Subsequently this security flaw was finally deemed important by Microsoft and it received CVE-2025-24054, for which I was finally retroactively credited as the original reporter.
