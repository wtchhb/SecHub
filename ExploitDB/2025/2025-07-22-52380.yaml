A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Live Helper Chat
version ≤ 4.61 allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript by
injecting a crafted payload into the Operator Chat Name Field Triggers on
Chat Owner Transfer Functionality on Live Helper Chat.

## Reproduction Steps:
1. Log in as an operator.
2. Navigate to your operator settings page.
3. In the **Name** field, enter the following payload:
   ```
  "><img src="x" onerror="prompt(1);">
   ```
4. Save the changes.
5. Initiate a chat with a visitor.
6. Transfer the chat to another operator — the XSS payload executes in the
receiving operator’s chat interface.
