# Reference:

A low-privileged user/operator injects a malicious JavaScript payload into
the Department Assignment "Alias Nick" field while assigning or editing
department access. When a higher-privileged user (e.g., admin or operator)
edits the department assignment "Alias Nick" field, the stored script is
executed in their browser context.

## Reproduction Steps:

1. Log in as an operator.
2. Navigate to your Department Assignment settings page.
3. In the "Alias Nick" field, enter the following payload:
   ```
  "><img src="x" onerror="prompt(1);">
   ```
4. Save the changes.
5. Revist the Department Assignment settings page and edit the Alias Nick
field, the cross site scripting (xss) will execute.
