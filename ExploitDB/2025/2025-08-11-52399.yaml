## Description
This PowerShell script checks if your Windows system is vulnerable to
**CVE-2025-49730**, a critical vulnerability in the `storqosflt.sys`
Storage QoS Filter Driver.

## Features

- Detects if the `storqosflt` driver is present.
- Retrieves the driver version and compares it against the known patched
version (`10.0.26100.1`).
- Verifies the driver's digital signature to ensure authenticity.
- Calculates the SHA-256 hash of the driver file for integrity verification.
- Retrieves recent system event logs related to `storqosflt` to identify
suspicious or unusual activity.

## Usage

1. Open PowerShell with Administrator privileges.
2. Run the script:

   ```powershell
   .\Check-StorQoS-CVE2025.ps1
   ```

3. Review the output:

   - **Red messages** indicate vulnerable or suspicious conditions (e.g.,
vulnerable driver version or invalid digital signature).
   - **Yellow messages** indicate warnings or missing data.
   - **Green messages** indicate good or safe status.

## Requirements

- Windows PowerShell (tested on Windows 10 and 11).
- Execution policy set to allow running local scripts (`Set-ExecutionPolicy
RemoteSigned` may be needed).
- Administrator privileges recommended for full access to driver info and
logs.

## Disclaimer

This script **does not** attempt to exploit the vulnerability. It only
checks system status to **prove** vulnerability presence or absence based
on driver version, signature, and logs.
