## Overview

This repository contains a PowerShell script to **validate whether a
Windows 11 system is vulnerable to CVE-2025-49744**—a critical local
privilege escalation vulnerability involving the `gdi32.dll` and
`win32kfull.sys` system components.

The script performs the following checks:

- Windows build number validation
- Installed hotfixes, focusing on July 2025 patches including **KB5039302**
- Binary timestamp verification of critical system files
- Safe, non-destructive GDI32 API interaction test
